# 1. meteorology only model - all variables all lags

## This was used to plot the smooth terms from meteorology data
mod.DM 

## 2.  meteorology only model the formula for lag>1

# mod.DM with lag>1
mod.DMgt1


## 3. Optimal lag model, this already has lag>1

#s(count1, k = 4) + s(count2, k = 4) + s(count23, k = 4)
mod.DDOptimal 





# 4. meteorology and past dengue incidences model - all variables lag > 1

mod.DMDgt1

### 5. Optimal representation model
# this has data for the summrounding district count data as well.

mod.DMDS_Optimalgt1 


### 6. Optimal Representation model + garbage data

mod.DMDSO
